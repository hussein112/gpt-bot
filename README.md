Simply put: 
1.	We have a collection of data vectorized and stored in a vector database.
2.	When a user asks a question, we retrieve the most relevant data from the vector store using similarity search.
3.	We pass the most relevant data to the LLM.
4.	Finally, the LLM â€“ using relevant data - generates a response.
